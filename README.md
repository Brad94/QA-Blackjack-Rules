List of all the rules for the QA blackjack games.

The list is in **rules.txt**.

To add your own changes follow the steps below (This is simplified workflow, with no branches, etc):

1. Click the fork button in the top right.
2. In your terminal/command prompt enter ```git clone git@github.com:YOURUSERNAME/FORKED-PROJECT.git```

To push the changes to your repository:

1. git init
2. git add .
3. git commit -m "Your message here"
4. git remote add origin https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/PROJECTNAME
5. git push origin master

Once you've committed and pushed all of your changes to GitHub, go to the page for your fork on GitHub, select your development branch, and click the pull request button. If you need to make any adjustments to your pull request, just push the updates to GitHub. Your pull request will automatically track the changes on your development branch and update.
